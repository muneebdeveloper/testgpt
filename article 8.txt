ABSTRACT
Historically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the workplace and influenced career opportunities afforded to
women in the public sector. The slow progress in the transformation of organisations indicates there is a need for a
structural developmental approach for women's career advancement. Mentoring has been recognised as a valu￾able development strategy and an affirmative action tool that can be used to support and promote women and
groups that have been viewed as previously disadvantaged. The aim of the study was to highlight the significance
of mentorship as a career advancement mechanism for women in the South African public sector. The study
identified dimensions of mentorship (female mentors, career support, mentoring policy and leadership devel￾opment) and tested the proposed hypotheses to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed
between mentorship and career advancement. A quantitative approach was followed to collect data from a sample
of 200 women employed in the public sector in the different provinces of South Africa. Statistical methods used to
conduct the data analysis included descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The results indicate that women
employees in the public sector view mentorship as an important factor for development; however, the gender of
the mentor does not necessarily influence career advancement. Mechanisms to support mentoring have not been
established in the public sector, highlighting the urgency for managers in the public sector to ensure that
mentorship policies are put in place.
1. Introduction
“A mentor is someone who allows you to see the hope inside yourself.”
Oprah Winfrey
Women in South Africa should be “allowed’’ to see the hope within
themselves and be empowered for career advancement in the workplace.
Studies indicate that organisations with more females in senior and ex￾ecutive positions are more successful in terms of decision making, pro￾ductivity and turnover (Blumberg, 2018; Onley, 2016). Yet, gender
equality in the workplace is still a myth (Coetzee, 2017). Booysen and
Nkomo (2014) hold a similar view, highlighting that social inequality
“remains stubborn” in South Africa. It seems that women need to “climb
every mountain, search high and low” (Hammerstein II, 1959) to
advance in their careers. Structural inequality in the workplace results in
the unequal and unfair treatment of women at work (Bosch, 2017). In
addition, transformation priorities in South Africa necessitate an increase
of black South African women in the workforce (Jaga et al., 2018). This
study suggests that mentorship in the public sector could be a vehicle to
inspire, develop and empower previously disadvantaged women in the
workplace.
Mentors with advanced experience and knowledge who are devoted
to contributing to the development of their proteges or mentees can make
a significant difference to women who aspire to be future leaders in or￾ganisations (Samier, 2000; Satter and Russ, 2007; Shen and Kram, 2011;
Weimers et al., 2013). Smith (2016) concurs and highlights that men￾toring is essential to the career advancement and success of professional
black African women. As women face more barriers than men in the
workplace, studies suggest that females have a greater need than males to
be mentored (Abalkhail and Allan, 2015; Hills, 2015; Kammeyer-Mueller
and Judge, 2008; Johnson and Mathur-Helm, 2011). However, in the
South African public sector, this phenomenon is not recognised and
mentorship for women seems to be “non-existent” (Rankumise, 2013).
Women in the public sector realise that they have to fend for themselves
as they try to find their own way to survive or advance in their
departments.

Policies and legislation, including South Africa's Employment Equity
Act (No. 55 of 1998), the Constitution (No. 108 of 1996), the White Paper
on Human Resources Management in the Public Service of 1997, and the
Women Empowerment and Gender Equality Bill (Government Gazette,
2013), are in place, yet the reality in the workplace seems to contradict
these policies. Twenty-seven years into the country's democracy and
transformation, men still hold most decision-making positions in the
public service sector (Department of Women - Annual Report,
2015/2016). Reports indicate that even though women constitute more
than 60% of employees in the public sector, they tend to hold lower levels
of occupational categories, namely, production and supervisory levels
(DPSA Annual Report, 2015/2016). Even “good-practice diversity in￾terventions” are not influencing and advancing women to an extent
which would ensure equal and favourable conditions for women in the
South African workplace (Booysen and Nkomo, 2014). Singh (2017)
argues that transformation for organisations is merely about “ticking the
box” and suggests organisations need to find new mechanisms to elimi￾nate the barriers that discriminate against women. In line with this view,
Bosch (2017) proposes that human resources management in organisa￾tions needs to devise policies and interventions for women in order to
manifest fairness in organisations.
Government departments are continually struggling to retain, reward
and develop their pool of public servants (Poocharoen and Lee, 2013).
Yokwana (2014) suggests that the lack of mentorship for women results
in slow career development, and a vast number of junior female em￾ployees opt to resign from their organisations due to a lack of promotion.
For bureaucratic organisations in the public service sector to be filled
with capable, skilled and competent employees, the sector needs to
empower and advance female employees (Roger, 2010).
Career advancement and promotion generally take place after em￾ployees acquire additional skills, experience, knowledge or education. A
literature review of various career theories – for example, the Career
Adaptability Theory (Bocciardi et al., 2017) and Boundaryless Career
Theory (Kuron et al., 2016) – reveals certain factors that influence career
advancement. These career theories, as well as literature on career
advancement, suggest that factors influencing the career advancement of
women can be categorised as either self-driven factors or
employer-driven factors (Bocciardi et al., 2017; Holton and Dent, 2016;
Kuron et al., 2016). Self-driven factors include pre-career choices (for
example, education), while employer-driven factors include mentorship
opportunities (B€
ohmer and Schinnenburg, 2016; Netnou and Strydom,
2020) – supporting the view that it is important for employers to intro￾duce mentorship initiatives to promote the career advancement of
women.
Although the literature indicates positive outcomes of mentorship for
the organisation and individuals, it is virtually silent on the role, out￾comes and consequences of mentorship for female employees in the
South African public sector. The primary objective of this study is to
elevate the importance of mentorship in the culture of the South African
public sector to support the advancement of junior female employees.
2. Literature review
The rise of women to leadership positions in South Africa is hampered
by a number of barriers (Bosch, 2017; Coetzee, 2017; Mokoena, 2018).
These include a history of institutional racism in South Africa, where the
rights of individuals were subject to race and gender, and sociocultural
theories that view women as inferior to men (Chiloane-Tsoka, 2010;
Hendrickse, 2004). This historical patriarchy had a negative influence on
the number of management positions offered to women in the South
African public sector. When considering the slow progress of trans￾formation in the public sector, the absence of mentors is deemed to have
had the biggest impact on the career advancement of women (Arnesson
and Albinsson, 2017; Hills, 2015; Mokoena, 2018; Satter and Russ, 2007;
Weimers et al., 2013). There are, however, diverse views on the defini￾tion of mentorship. In the South African context, there is disagreement on
the meaning of the term “mentorship” when comparing it to activities
that are similar, such as coaching and counselling (Goosen, 2009).
Mentoring in business studies finds its roots in the early work of Kram
(1985, p. 23), in which mentoring is described as “developmental re￾lationships between younger and older managers that promote individ￾ual development through career stages”. Lankau and Scandura (2002),
on the other hand, describe mentoring as a relationship that contributes
to personal growth without restricting the relationship to seniority and
power. Mentorship is commonly professed to be a dynamic and trans￾formative relationship which affects both parties – the mentor and
mentee, or protege – as well as their respective careers and personal and
professional development (Arnesson and Albinsson, 2017; Cooke et al.,
2017; Roger, 2010). Other elements mentioned in the literature as
essential to the mentoring relationship include that it is a relationship
built on trust; it should possess a domain of ethics; and the mentor should
be a role model to the mentee (Bozeman and Feeney, 2009; Harris and
Leberman, 2012; Jyoti and Sharma, 2015).
In clarifying the term “mentorship”, Arnesson and Albinsson (2017)
refer to the misperception regarding mentorship and supervision, spe￾cifically the similarities and differences between these two concepts.
They explain that supervision is compulsory and includes evaluation,
whereas these obligations do not apply to mentorship. The advantages of
a mentoring relationship, as depicted in these descriptions, include
improved job performance and job satisfaction (Cooke et al., 2017). In
summarising the various definitions of mentorship, it is noted that all
contain a common thread in that they involve an exchange of benefits
between the mentor, the protege and the organisation.
Western and Asian countries have provided much literature on the
significance of mentorship in the success of women's careers; however,
most of the studies are focused on a single country or a single sector
(Abalkhail and Allan, 2015; Arifeen, 2010; Mustafa et al., 2014; Yok￾wana, 2014). Therefore, transferability to South Africa's public service
context is unclear. For example, Bhatta and Washington (2003) state that
in the Japanese public sector, junior staff members are assigned to a
mentor when they join the public service sector, and the mentor guides
them for a considerable period of time, while in the elite public service
sector of Singapore, junior staff members are assigned to a mentor who
offers them friendly advice and training. Furthermore, Abalkhail and
Allan (2015) provide contrasting views regarding the importance of
mentorship to women in junior positions in two countries, namely, Saudi
Arabia and the United Kingdom (UK). Their study concludes that women
in Saudi Arabia do not recognise the importance of mentorship in the
workplace, mainly due to cultural beliefs, as they consider mentors as
only members of their family. However, women in the UK view
mentorship as important to their career development.
Regrettably, such mentorship opportunities are not prevalent in the
public sector of South Africa. Women in the South African public sector
are therefore compelled to develop themselves and climb the hierarchical
ladder without being mentored (Coetzee, 2017; Weimers et al., 2013). A
further challenge is that the public sector is rigid, with inflexible rules,
and this type of organisational structure could hamper the advancement
of women (Sadangharn, 2010). Literature suggests that, for a mentoring
culture to exist, management needs to be flexible and progressive so
strategies can be adopted and policies revised (Apospori et al., 2006;
Jyoti and Sharma, 2015; Mokoena, 2018). In addition, the public sector
in South Africa needs to consider the outcomes of the Women Empow￾erment and Gender Equality Bill (Government Gazette, 2013), which
include “equal representation and an increased participation by building
females’ capacity”. This Bill provides further justification for exploring
the significance of mentorship in supporting the career advancement of
women in the public sector.
3. Theoretical framework
The framework guiding this study was informed by existing theories
and models of mentorship found in the literature. Table 1 below provides
M. Mcilongo, K. Strydom Heliyon 7 (2021) e07321
2
the justification for the dimensions of mentorship as applied and tested in
this study.
3.1. Proposed framework for the hypothesised relationships
The theories and models in Table 1 provided the framework for the
mentorship dimensions and the proposed hypotheses.

Female mentors
Coetzee (2017) proposes that organisations should cater specifically
for the unique needs of women. Studies suggest that female mentors are
best for the career development of other females (Arifeen, 2010; Mello
and Phago, 2007; Tharenou, 2005). Gerber and Schlechter (2019) found
that women embrace solidarity and support each other. Women who
have female mentors can learn more strategies for dealing with barriers
in the workplace and gain more career support than if they had a male
mentor (Tannen, 2010). In addition, “black African women in leadership
serve as important role models to a younger generation of South African
women” (Bosch, 2020).
The following hypothesis was therefore proposed:
H1. There is a positive relationship between female mentor support and
the career advancement of junior female proteges.

Career support
Mentor career support involves sponsoring the protege in order to
advance them through coaching, giving challenging assignments,
providing network connections, and making proteges visible in the
organisation (Eby et al., 2004). It can therefore be argued that mentor
career support can ensure that a protege advances in the hierarchy of the
organisation. Pan et al. (2011) concur with the notion that mentor career
support can help women advance and highlight that it is a very important
element of mentoring. Madsen and Andrade (2018) propose that training
and development, and thus also mentoring, should address unconscious
gender bias at the workplace. This led to the following hypothesis being
proposed:
H2. There is a positive relationship between mentor career support and
higher levels of career advancement for junior female employee proteges.

Mentoring policy
One of the reasons mentoring is advocated as a policy mechanism is
that, traditionally, mentoring is selective (Ehrich, 2008; Alkadry and
Tower, 2011). It is not available to all those who need a mentoring
relationship. Most mentors tend to gravitate towards those proteges who
they feel they have something in common with (Apospori, et al., 2006). It
is for these reasons that a formal mentoring policy for females is advo￾cated so that all potential proteges can be included. Bangura and Thomas
(2015) affirm that there is a direct relationship between governance and
gender equality, indicating the importance of a formal mentoring policy.
The following was therefore hypothesised:
H3. A formal mentoring policy for females in the public sector is
positively related to higher levels of career advancement.

Leadership development
Mmope (2020) suggests that management should consider mentor￾ship strategies for professional black women through ubuntu-infused
leadership. This leadership style would encourage the development of
female employees. The leadership development of employees can posi￾tively affect organisational capacity and capacitate employees to assume
leadership roles in the organisation (Bhatta and Washington, 2003;
Potgieter, 2011; Weimers et al., 2013). Women should be empowered to
be insightful, visionary leaders who create environments in which di￾versity and excellence thrive (Nhamo and Mjimba, 2020). Mentoring can
thus enable the leadership development of employees. The following
hypothesis was therefore proposed:
H4. Mentoring for leadership development has a positive relationship
to the career advancement of junior female employees.
These four hypotheses were empirically tested to determine whether
a statistically significantly relationship existed between mentorship and
career advancement within the public sector of South Africa.
4. Research methodology
4.1. Research paradigm
A quantitative research approach was adopted for this study. The
quantitative research paradigm was selected because the study involved
Table 1. Mentorship dimensions with supporting theories or models.
MENTORSHIP
DIMENSION
THEORY OR MODEL
Mentoring support for female
employees by female mentors
The similarity attraction theory of
mentorship states that people have
a tendency to be attracted to
people they deem similar to them
(Kalbfleisch and Davies, 1991;
Young et al., 2006). When women
find role models and mentors in
other women, their productivity
and careers can be enhanced. This
theory also suggests that female
employees are more likely to
understand female managers than
male managers (Valentine and
Godkin, 2000; Mello and Phago,
2007).
Mentoring career support
(coaching, networking) can assist
women in career advancement
The Clutterbuck empirical model
for mentorship views mentorship
as a way to expand knowledge and
skills through coaching, guiding,
counselling and networking
(Stroude et al., 2015). Career
support that includes coaching,
sponsoring proteges and providing
challenging assignments is argued
to help proteges advance along the
hierarchical ladder of the
organisation (Tharenou, 2005).
Mentoring policy for women can
assist in career advancement
Zey's (1989) model for mentorship
(as quoted in Samier, 2000, p. 89)
advocates for a mentoring policy
to be developed in public sector
organisations. Such a policy can
lead to formal programmes, and it
has been reported that formal
mentorship programmes can lead
to career advancement (Ehrich,
2008).
Mentoring for leadership
development of women
Mentorship plays a significant role
in leadership development and
continuity in the public sector
(Bozeman and Feeney, 2009).
Bozeman and Feeney's (2009)
three-tier model for mentoring in
the public sector maintains that it
is very important for the public
sector to groom its leadership.
This model therefore views
mentorship as a tool that can be
used to prepare executives and to
achieve adaptation.

a large number of subjects, and a quantitative approach would allow the
data to be analysed numerically. Futhermore, the study presented hy￾potheses, and the most accurate way to test hyphotheses is with the use of
the quantitative paradigm.
4.2. Sample
The target population for this study comprised entry-level junior
females in the South African public sector, on salary levels 5 to 10
(production and supervisor-level female employees), who would benefit
from mentorship and career advancement and who aspire to move up
the career ladder. The South African public service workforce comprises
approximately 1 244 852 people, of which 580 223 are women
employed at a salary level of 5–10 (DPSA Annual Report, 2015/2016).
Targeted random sampling was used for this study to ensure an unbi￾ased sample within the target group (female employees on salary level
5 to 10), as an unbiased sample is the most appropriate criterion to
evaluate the adequacy of a sample (Bryman and Bell, 2015). In addi￾tion, random sampling is representative of the entire population and
enables accuracy of representation for large populations (Maree, 2016).
An invitation to participate in the study was emailed to female em￾ployees in the public sector who are at salary levels 5 to 10. The de￾cision to participate in the study was solely up to the respondents and
everyone who responded positively was provided a questionnaire via
email.
The formula to determine the appropriate sample size is as follows:
N/(N*(d)2 þ 1), where N ¼ number of population size and d ¼ degree of
confidence (Israel, 2013). The sample size for this study which yielded a
95% degree of confidence was 400. However, for the purpose of this
study, it was envisaged that a sample size of 200 would be appropriate
and produce statistically significant results. It is estimated that a sample
size of 200 has a margin of error of 7.1%, which is acceptable, and can
produce statistically significant results (Niles, 2006). Conroy (2012) also
concludes that an acceptable margin of error lies between 4 and 8%,
which supports the notion that the results of the study would yield
acceptable results with a sample size of 200 respondents.
4.3. Research instrument
A structured questionnaire was drafted based information obtained
from the literature. A quantitative research approach was employed to
seek statistical associations and relationships between factors affecting
mentorship (dependent variables) and career advancement (independent
variable). Mentorship dimensions (female mentors, career support,
mentoring policy and leadership development) were identified from
theoretical models and were supported by literature. Hypotheses were
constructed to show each factor and its relationship to career advance￾ment. The purpose of the measuring instrument was to obtain primary
data to test the hypothesised relationships.
The items on the questionnaire were anchored by a five-point Likert
scale. A pilot study was conducted to test the questionnaire on five in￾dividuals who represented the target population. Further amendments,
as suggested by these individuals, were made to the questionnaire. Ethics
approval was received from the Research Director at Nelson Mandela
University before the researchers emailed the questionnaires to the 200
female respondents.
Both content and construct validity were ensured by linking the
mentoring theory and literature underlying the research to the items in
the questionnaire, and by confirming that the measurements on the
scales correlated with other propositions. Internal consistency was tested
using Cronbach's alpha coefficient analysis, the most appropriate reli￾ability testing method for this study. The coefficient analysis describes
the extent to which all items in a test measure the same construct and is
suitable for the purpose (Taber, 2017). If the items are strongly corre￾lated with each other, their internal consistency is high and the alpha
coefficient will be close to one (Bryman and Bell, 2015).
Section A of the questionnaire focused on the demographic profiles of
the respondents, and Section B comprised attitude scales to determine the
perceptions of respondents on the influence of mentorship on career
advancement. The results of the coefficient analysis indicated that the
Cronbach's alpha for Section B of the questionnaire (Mentorship), which
consisted of 25 questionnaire items, was 0.840 (84%). This suggests that
the questions had a relatively high internal consistency, since an
acceptable reliability scale is 70% and values lower than 0.60 are
regarded as unacceptable (Maree, 2016). In support of the high internal
consistency of this study, Taber (2017) suggests that values of 0.80 or
above indicate excellent reliability.
4.4. Data analysis
A questionnaire was used to obtain data from respondents; there￾after, the collected data were exported to Microsoft Excel for coding and
to tabulate the data. The study employed descriptive and inferential
statistics, the two most commonly used data analysis techniques for
quantitative data (Bryman and Bell, 2015). Descriptive statistics were
used to summarise the data and compare the variables numerically, as
per Maree (2016). The mean and standard deviation of each of the
statements of the mentorship dimensions, namely, mentor gender,
career support, mentoring policy and leadership development, were
reported.
Inferential statistics were used to generalise the findings from the
sample (200 women in the public sector) to the entire population.
Inferential statistics, namely, ANOVA and the Chi-square test, were
employed to determine the statistical significant relationships among
variables – in this case, the relationship of each mentorship dimension
with career advancement – and confirm whether a hypothesis had
been supported or rejected (Conroy, 2012; Taber, 2017). Concur￾rently, inferential statistics were used to draw conclusions from the
data (Bryman and Bell, 2015). The computer software package, SPSS
version 21.0., was used to execute the quantitative statistical analysis.
5. Results
The results included the demographic profiles of the respondents,
descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square. The
sample size was 200, and all questionnaires that were sent out were
returned unspoilt (100% response rate). Prior to conducting a detailed
analysis of the data, the data were checked for normality. The normality
of data is assumed when “the significance level is greater than 0.05” (Pallant, 2007, p. 54). In terms of the result, as obtained from the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K–S) test for normality, the data were normally
distributed since the p-value was 0.614.
5.1. Demographic profiles of the respondents
Section A of the questionnaire aimed to profile respondents based on
demographic information. The aim was to establish the distribution of
demographic information in terms of the respondents’ highest level of
qualification and employment level/grade.

Highest level of education
Career advancement is directly related to the education of candidates.
This analysis therefore sought to ascertain the distribution of the re￾spondents based on their highest level of education. In terms of the data
presented, 64.5% of the respondents had acquired at least a National
Diploma while 34.5% were in possession of a Senior Certificate as their
highest qualification. In essence, all the respondents had acquired at least
a Senior Certificate. This implies that all female employees who partici￾pated in the survey have the potential to develop if education was used as
a measure of the intention to further develop their career.

 Post level/position grades
The purpose of this question was to identify the variations and dis￾tribution of respondents with regard to their post level or position grade.
The distribution indicated that most respondents (76%) were split
equally between post level 7–8 (38%) and post level 9–10 (38%). More
than three-quarters of the entire sample had advanced from one level to
another. Only 24% of the respondents were at level 5–6. Post level is a
measure of whether an individual has advanced in terms of their career
or not. This information is crucial, since the perception of people
regarding the influence of mentorship on career advancement can relate
to whether the individual has experienced an upgrade of their post level.
5.2. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
ANOVA was conducted in order to compare differences within groups
of demographic variables (employment level, highest qualification) with
regard to the respondents’ knowledge of and experience with the impact
of mentorship on career advancement. The Pearson correlation p-value of
(p < 0.05) was used to test the significance of the differences. If the p￾value is less than 0.05, it can be assumed that there is a statistically
significant difference between groups or categories of the demographic
variables with regard to the factor of comparison (Maree, 2016). The
F-statistic states the spread or strength of the demographic in relation to
factors that influence mentorship and career advancement. The higher
the F-value, the larger the spread (Hurlbert, 1984).
It can be observed that the significance levels (p-values) of the de￾terminants of mentorship are all larger than 0.05 (Table 2). The results
show that the responses are similar irrespective of employment level or
highest qualification, and indicate that generally the experience or
opinions of the respondents did not vary much based on their employ￾ment level and education. The F-values indicates that the spread of re￾sponses varied slightly among respondents with different levels of
employment and qualifications.
5.3. Descriptive statistics
The following section presents the results of the analysis of descrip￾tive statistics for all the dimensions deemed to determine the influence of
mentorship towards career advancement.
The results presented in Table 3 show that the dimension “Mentor
gender”, with the statement “Mentoring support is more important for
women's career advancement” (mean 3.61; standard deviation 1.084)
and the variable “A female mentor can teach me how to deal with barriers
in my organisation” (mean 3.28; standard deviation 1.023), were the
most dominant factors. The factor “Mentorship is more effective if the
mentor is the same gender” was the least dominant factor, with a mean of
2.66 and standard deviation of 1.274. Although all the factors suggest
that the gender of the mentor plays a significant role in influencing in￾dividual career advancement, the mean values were only marginally
above average. In essence, all the factors endorsed the significance of
mentor gender in influencing career advancement, but inferential sta￾tistics with the help of a chi-square test provided true statistical
confirmation.
The dimension “Career support” (Table 3) had the highest mean
(4.32), suggesting that the majority of the respondents (85.5%)
acknowledged that mentorship has a significant impact on women's
career advancement. The second most important factor, “Mentorship can
provide opportunities for me to interact in a meaningful way with
mentors”, had a mean score of 4.30 and standard deviation of 0.782,
which suggests that 90% of women were of the belief that mentorship
provides room for interaction with mentors. Although the variable
“Mentoring will enable me to move to the next job level” had the lowest
mean (3.92), it was above the midpoint (2.5) and the majority of the
respondents (40.5% strongly agree and 30% agree) therefore acknowl￾edged that mentorship improved the chances of advancing to a better
working position in an organisation.
According to the evidence presented for the dimension “Mentoring
policy” (Table 3), approximately 77% of the respondents argued in
favour of the statement, “A mentoring policy will encourage the career
advancement of women”. This variable had the highest mean (4.09) and
standard deviation (1.008). Furthermore, over 77 (26% strongly agree
and 51% agree) of the respondents were of the opinion that a formal
mentoring programme would encourage potential proteges. Although
the variable “There is a formal mentoring programme in my organisa￾tion” had the lowest mean score (2.63), it was well above the midpoint
(2.5). This confirmed there is a general consensus that mentoring policy
plays a crucial role in supporting mentorship within an organisation, thus
positively impacting the career advancement of women.
The evidence presented in Table 3 under “Leadership development”
shows that the variable “Mentorship can improve leadership develop￾ment in my organisation” had the highest mean (4.28), followed by
“Mentorship can enable me to be an effective leader in my organisation”,
with a mean of 4.20. The variable with the lowest score was “There is a
clear strategy for leadership development of women in my organisation”,
with a mean of 2.97. All the variables had a mean score of more than 2.5,
suggesting that mentorship significantly influences leadership develop￾ment, which in turn has a positive influence on the career advancement
of women.
5.4. Hypotheses testing: Chi-square test
This study utilised Pearson's chi-square test of association in order
to determine the relationships between determinants of mentorship
and career advancement. Through Pearson's chi-square test, the null
hypothesis is either true or false (Greenwood and Nikulin, 1996). If
the value of the test is too small, then the null hypothesis is false. The
linear-by-linear association is also presented to test for association
among the variables. If the sig. “p” value is <0.05, it means that there
is a statistically significant relationship between the variables, and
the null hypothesis is rejected. However, if the sig. “p” value is
>0.05, it means that there is no statistically significant relationship
between the variables, which means the null hypothesis is not false,
but rather the alternative hypothesis is not true (Greenwood and
Nikulin, 1996).
In order to determine the association between the knowledge and
experience of the participants regarding the importance of each
mentorship variable and career advancement, cross-tabulation was con￾ducted. The cross-tabulation included the following variables from the
Table 2. ANOVA: Employment level and highest qualification.

research hypotheses: female mentor support, career support, mentoring
policy and mentoring for leadership development. In order to confirm the
significance and strength of the relationship, the symmetric measure
from the chi-square analysis was considered.

Hypothesis 1: Female mentor support and career advancement
The cross-tabulation of the factors for female mentor support and
career advancement was conducted and yielded the results presented in
Table 4.
Assuming that Pearson's chi-square is significant at p < 0.05, Table 4
shows that Pearson's chi-square is p ¼ 0.307, at pχ(1) ¼ 18.297. The p￾value “sig.” is above 0.05; therefore, the results suggest that there is no
statistical significant relationship between female mentor support and
career advancement. The result indicates that the gender of a mentor
does not necessarily lead to career advancement. It can be concluded that
there is no statistical significant relationship between female mentor
support and career advancement; thus, the null hypothesis is not rejected:
(H1 not accepted):
H1. Female mentor support will have a positive impact on the career
advancement of junior female proteges.

Hypothesis 2: Career support and career advancement
The cross-tabulation of the factors for career support and career
advancement was conducted and yielded the results presented in Table 5.
The results in Table 5 indicate that there is a statistically significant
association between career support and career advancement. Pearson's
chi-square is significant at p < 0.05. It can be observed that Pearson's chi￾square is p ¼ 0.000, at pχ(1) ¼ 490.009. This indicates that career sup￾port plays an important role in supporting career advancement. In order
to confirm the significance and strength of the relationship, the sym￾metric measures from the chi-square analysis were considered. The

results indicate that there is a strong positive relationship between career
support and career advancement. Therefore, the null hypothesis is
rejected and the alternative hypothesis is retained, which is as follows:
H2. There is a positive relationship between mentor career support and
higher levels of career advancement for junior female employee proteges.

Hypothesis 3: Mentoring policy and career advancement
The cross-tabulation of the factors for mentoring policy and career
advancement was conducted and yielded the results presented in
Table 6.
The results in Table 6 show that there is a statistically significant
relationship between mentoring policy and career advancement. Pear￾son's chi-square is significant at p < 0.05. It can be observed that Pear￾son's chi-square is p ¼ 0.000, at pχ(1) ¼ 70.585. The symmetric measures
from the chi-square analysis were considered and the results confirm that
there is a statistically significant relationship between mentoring policy
and career advancement. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and
the alternative hypothesis is retained, which is as follows:
H3. A formal mentoring policy for females in the public sector is
positively related to higher levels of career advancement.

Hypothesis 4: Leadership development and career advancement
The cross-tabulation of the factors for leadership development and
career advancement was conducted and yielded the results presented in
Table 7.
According to Table 7, there is a statistically significant relationship
between leadership development and career advancement. Pearson's chi￾square is significant at p < 0.05. It can be observed that Pearson's chi￾square is p ¼ 0.000, at pχ(1) ¼ 162.546. The symmetric measures in
the above table confirm the significance and strength of the relationship.
It can be concluded that there is a statistically significant association
between leadership development and career advancement. The null hy￾pothesis is therefore rejected and the alternative hypothesis is retained,
which is as follows:
H4. Mentoring for leadership development has a positive relationship
to the career advancement of junior female employees.
The results of the chi-square test indicate that three of the four di￾mensions of mentorship, namely career support, mentoring policy and
leadership development, have a statistically significant relationship with
career advancement. Contrary to the literature (Arifeen, 2010; Mello and
Phago, 2007; Tannen, 2010; Tharenou, 2005), the study found no sta￾tistically significant relationship between female mentor support and
career advancement.
6. Discussion of findings
The respondents, independent of their qualifications and employment
level, did not prefer or display any peculiar affinity for the gender of the
mentor, as long as they could learn from the mentor. This indicates that
the gender of the mentor is not important. This is confirmed by the results
of testing Hypothesis 1 (Table 4), which yielded a value of p ¼ 0.307,
indicating that there is no statistically significant relationship between
female mentor support and career advancement. However, contrary to
this finding, previous studies suggest that career development is
improved when women find role models and mentors in other women,
who are more likely to understand them (Arifeen, 2010; Gerber and
Schlechter, 2019; Tannen, 2010; Valentine and Godkin, 2000).
The results also showed that the respondents felt optimistic about
their career advancement through career support. The majority of the
respondents (85.5%) acknowledged that mentoring career support has a
significant impact on women's career advancement. This opinion of the
respondents is confirmed by the results of Hypothesis 2 (Table 5), which
indicate that there is a strong positive relationship between career sup￾port and career advancement. This is consistent with the literature
(Madsen and Andrade, 2018; Pan et al., 2011; Stroude et al., 2015;
Tharenou, 2005), which is unambiguous about the assistance of career
support in advancing women on the hierarchical ladder.
The respondents, independent of their qualifications and employment
level, were moderately satisfied with the role of a mentoring policy for
women in the public sector and how it could positively impact their
career advancement; however, the presence of a mentoring policy does
not necessarily guarantee career advancement. The study was able to
provide empirical evidence to support Hypothesis 3 (Table 6),
concluding that there is a statistically significant relationship between
mentoring policy and the career advancement of women in the public
sector. This finding supports literature which reports that formal
mentorship programmes can lead to career advancement, citing a direct
relationship between governance and gender equality (Alkadry and
Tower, 2011; Bangura and Thomas, 2015; Ehrich, 2008).
The descriptive statistics revealed that there is a significant and strong
relationship between leadership development and career advancement.
The majority of respondents signified that mentorship can improve
leadership development for women in the public sector. It can thus be
reasoned that there is a strong association between leadership develop￾ment, career advancement and mentorship. This relationship is
confirmed by the results of Hypothesis 4 (Table 7), which indicate a
statistically significant association between leadership development and
career advancement. Literature supports this finding, highlighting the
significance of leadership development for women in the public sector
(Bozeman and Feeney, 2009; Mmope, 2020; Potgieter, 2011; Weimers
et al., 2013).

7. Managerial implications
In order to promote fairness and eliminate elements of patriarchy
from government organisations, the government needs to devise policies,
training and development for women. The government may use
mentorship as an instrument to remove certain barriers that interfere
with the progress of women.
Besides certain policies and legislation, including South Africa's
Employment Equity Act (No. 55 of 1998), the Constitution (No. 108 of
1996), the White Paper on Human Resources Management in the Public
Service of 1997, and the Women Empowerment and Gender Equality Bill
(Government Gazette, 2013), the public sector does not have mecha￾nisms in place for mentoring initiatives that support current legislation
and policies. Management should ensure that such mechanisms are
implemented.
Meaningful mentorship training should be provided for management
to equip managers or senior employees with the necessary skills to
mentor young women. In addition, training will also assist managers to
identify possible proteges in their respective departments and sections.
This mentorship training could be done by designing an induction plan
for managers, which would ensure that managers are well equipped to
mentor and assist less-experienced managers.
It is crucial that managers in the public sector recognise that men￾toring can be an efficient career advancement strategy for women, with
positive outcomes for both employees and the organisation. Without
management's support and encouragement to ensure that mentorship
practices and policies are in place and effectively monitored, these pro￾posals will be merely suggestions on paper or strategic plans that are not
operationalised and implemented.
8. Recommendations
Women in the public sector believe that mentorship plays an impor￾tant role in their career development; however, women are not always
convinced that the mentorship programme will be effectively imple￾mented. The following recommendations are proposed:

Management should ensure that a formal mentorship programme is
developed and included in the organisation's policy for the empow￾erment of women in the public sector.

Operational plans should include regular follow-ups to ensure that
departments are implementing the mentorship programme through
their respective Human Resources Departments.

Management should ensure that there is a policy document that ex￾plains the process of mentorship and how the mentoring relationship
is approached, and clarifies the roles of the mentor and mentee.

A dedicated person or people in the Human Resources Department are
tasked to act as the liaison between management and employees
regarding the mentorship initiative.

Public departments should engage the assistance of the private sector
through consulting agencies that specialise in mentorship and
coaching to assist in creating a mentorship programme that will fit the
public sector and that will specifically benefit women in the public
sector.
9. Conclusion
The aim of the study was to determine the significance of mentorship
in the career advancement of women in the South African public sector.
The results of the study show that junior female employees in the public
sector view mentorship as an important factor in their career advance￾ment. The results suggest that the respondents were of the opinion that
the gender of a mentor does not necessarily lead to career advancement.
Even though legislation is in place to ensure equal rights and equal
opportunities for women in South Africa, it is evident that mechanisms to
enforce this are not in place. The findings revealed that departments in
the public sector do not have formal policies for mentorship or mentor￾ship programmes. Mechanisms to support mentoring have not yet been
established.
If the recommendations of Erwee (1992), in the paper “Organiza￾tional variables influencing female advancement in South Africa” are
considered, it seems that the same recommendations for women remain
relevant now, 29 years later, namely: “solutions to the slower advance￾ment of women in organizations should be sought in both personal action
plans formulated by career-oriented women and creation of enabling
conditions in companies”. This study suggests that it is now the time for
action, and women should take a leading role in building networks and
ensuring that management promotes mentorship for women as a top
priority in their organisations.
Women in the public sector should not wait indefinitely for formal
mentoring programmes from management. In the interim, they should
take the initiative to arrange mentorship programmes and networks
amongst themselves to ensure that both mentor and protege are moti￾vated by this developmental relationship.
